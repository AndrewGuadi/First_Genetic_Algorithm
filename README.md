# First_Genetic_Algorithm
I am trying to get more comfortable thinking abstractly to solve problems in python. I started learning python 3 months ago and this is my first shot at a genetic algorithm without any guidance except the key elements necessary for a genetic algorithm: 1) Heredity, 2) Variation 3)Selection

Someone Please help me understand what exactly I am supposed to include in the readme.md file.


Thank you, 
I would also like some advice on other algorithmic problems I can use to strengthen my understanding of creating algorithms and using python.
